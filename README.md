<b>Functional Requirements </b>:

Android version should be 5.1 or higher.

Tools and technologies to be used:

I. Android SDK

<i>The Android SDK is available for download completely free via Android‘s main website. It provides developers the API libraries
and tools necessary to build, test and debug apps for Android. In addition, the Android library includes specifications for
the use of multitasking, drag and drop and swiping between screens. Since different computer platforms require different types
of SDK, a proper checking in terms of compatibility and system requirements should be performed before downloading and installing
a SDK. The Android Studio is a platform which allows programmers to code in Java to develop an android application system.</i>





II. Java Programming Language

<i>Most of the important features and interfaces can be developed using Java. Since Android implements the open source platform,
available code samples and support from fellow developers or forum can be easily accessed thus making finding, sharing and 
the enhancement of solutions for problems a comfortable experience.</i>





III.SQLITE DATABASE​:

<i>SQLite is an open source SQL database that stores data to a text file on a device. Android comes in with built in SQLite database implementation. SQLite supports all the relational database features. In order to access this database, you don't need to establish any kind of connections for it like JDBC, ODBC, etc.
This application uses SQLite to store the things like ​ENTRIES AND TAGS ​created by the user. </i>
